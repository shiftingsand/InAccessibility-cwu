# InAccessibility
I'm [Chris Wu](https://twitter.com/MuseumShuffle) and this is my entry. My two main goals were to make this app useable for people that use very large accessibility fonts (even on very small screens) and VoiceOver users.

I did [some research](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/examining-data-viz-rules-dont-use-red-green-together) and found that green/red colorblindness is very common. I changed the gear button so that it would go to a settings menu where the user can choose colors that are hopefully more useful.

I also thought the black graph was hard to read in dark mode so I had that change when toggling between light and dark mode.

I coded this as an iPhone app!!!

A SwiftUI app that's not very accessible... On purpose

This app is part of the [Accessibility](https://www.swiftuiseries.com/accessibility) event during the SwiftUI Series. This project has been made inaccessible and non-inclusive on purpose. Can you fix the 20+ areas that can be improved?
